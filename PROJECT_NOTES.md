# Project Notes

## AI SWE Methodology Template

I love what we have now! I think that we need to make a template out of this.

This project serves as a complete reference implementation of the AI Software Engineering (AI SWE) methodology based on the article: https://habr.com/ru/articles/934806/

### What Makes This a Great Template

1. **Complete Memory Bank System** - Fully documented with real examples
2. **Custom Commands** - Both global and project-specific commands
3. **Three-Phase Workflow** - Planning-Execution-Review fully implemented
4. **Comprehensive Documentation** - Over 9,200 lines of guides, patterns, and workflows
5. **Git Flow Integration** - Proper versioning and release management
6. **English-Only** - All documentation translated from Russian to English

### To Use This as a Template

1. Clone this repository
2. Update `.memory_bank/product_brief.md` with your project details
3. Update `.memory_bank/tech_stack.md` with your technology choices
4. Customize workflows in `.memory_bank/workflows/` as needed
5. Update `CLAUDE.md` with project-specific instructions
6. Start development with `/refresh_context` and appropriate workflows

### Key Features

- **Memory Bank**: 13 files, 3,541 lines of project knowledge
- **Custom Commands**: 5 global commands for workflow automation
- **Documentation**: 27 files total, ~270KB of comprehensive guides
- **Validation**: 100% complete and production-ready

### Repository Structure

See `FILE_INDEX.md` for complete file listing and organization.

### Quick Start

See `QUICK_START.md` for daily workflow and command reference.

### Future Enhancements

- [ ] Create GitHub template repository
- [ ] Add language-specific templates (Python, JavaScript, Go, etc.)
- [ ] Add industry-specific adaptations (FinTech, HealthTech, etc.)
- [ ] Create setup wizard for new projects
- [ ] Add CI/CD pipeline templates
- [ ] Create Docker configuration examples
